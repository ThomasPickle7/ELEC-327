SIMON GAME (With bonus Piano Tiles):
This is a simon game; there are 4 buttons and 4 LEDs, and the user must press the buttons in the order given by the system. Additionally, For extra credit I implemented a simple difficulty parameter, which can be used to make the game more difficult by giving the player less time to give their input. I also implemented an additional game that is meant to emulate the mobile game Piano Tiles. There are recommendations of how to set the parameters for each game, though theyre only recommendations.

(EXTRA CREDIT) PIANO TILES:
The rules of piano tiles are simple: during gameplay, a single LEd lights up, and the player must press the corresponding button. If they take too long or press the wrong one, the game ends.
to set the game as Piano Tiles, change the game_toggle parameter to 1, and back to 0 for Simon.

GENERAL:
When the program starts, it plays the losing sequence indefinitely. Press any button to start the game. After the game has been won or lost, pressing any button will restart the game, with a fresh sequence of random buttons to press.

BUGS:
My game has one primary bugs:
- Though the serial output worked on my machine, I tested it on other people's computers and wasn't able to get anything out of them.
Though this issue may not impede the game, I did want to note it because I only ever got it to work on my machine a few times. I did attempt both of this criteria and achieve code that compiles, so I think at least partial credit for this section is reasonable to ask for.
Otherwise, I attempted all objectives, met almost all of them, and did the extra credit, so I think I deserve 145/150.
